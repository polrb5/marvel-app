# Marvel App

This is a Marvel app built with Vite and TypeScript. It utilizes the Marvel API to display information about comics. The app is developed using React and styled-components.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:polrb5/marvel-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd marvel-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using yarn:

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server using Vite. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

   If Vite assigns a different port during development, it will be displayed in the console output. Use the provided port number to access the app.

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the Marvel app in action.

## Build

To build the production-ready version of the app, run the following command:

```shell
yarn build
```

This command will generate the optimized and bundled version of the app in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

The app has been deployed to Vercel. You can access the live version of the app [here](https://marvel-app-polrb5.vercel.app/).
